# Speaker-Identification-Text-Analysis-
The aim of this project was to build a model, that given a sample line of dialog, could identify the character from a TV series most likely to have spoken it. The data set chosen for the project and published to Kaggle is 18 seasons worth of dialog from the animated Comedy Central series, South Park.
